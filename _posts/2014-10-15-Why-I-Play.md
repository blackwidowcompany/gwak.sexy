First off, hello!

I've been thinking about Planetside 2 quite a bit lately. It's the game I've spent the most time playing, by a signficant margin, and I wanted to share what keeps me going.

- I played BF3 semi-seriously with a great group of guys over at [Irregular Gamers](http://www.irregulargamers.com/). When Planetside 2 came out in 2012, a few of us went to check it out, and I stayed.
- My account has been active since 11 December 2012. 673 days old.
- After a few months, I started playing with [Litre of Cola](http://stats.dasanfall.com/ps2/outfit/LOC), who are great, but the allure of a larger outfit drew me over to [Black Widow Company](http://the-bwc.com).
- I joined [BWC](http://the-bwc.com/forum/showthread.php?38867-Planetside-2-Application-gwak&highlight=gwak+application) on 26 July 2013 - almost a year and 3 months ago.

Since then, my relationship with the game has changed dramatically. For a long time, I thought it was the game that had a hold on me, but recently I've come to realize that that's not the case. It's the people I play with that keep me motivated to keep playing. Planetside is a sandbox for building communities, and I'm lucky to have found a community I enjoy. 

Anyways, [Moukass](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-SqzlJh3Bllv9kR4V2Kw8A) put together a [fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_PSjQQrGCo&feature=youtu.be) detailing what makes this game special; you all should watch it. In the future, I'll be posting more content focusing on the squad and platoon level aspects of the game.
